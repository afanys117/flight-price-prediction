# Flight Price Prediction

## Predicting Flight Prices

## Introduction

In today's world, where travel has become an integral part of our lives, securing the best deals on flight tickets is of utmost importance. Flight prices are dynamic, influenced by a myriad of factors, including airline carriers, booking windows, departure times, and class preferences. For travelers seeking cost-effective and efficient ways to plan their journeys, understanding the underlying patterns in flight ticket pricing is invaluable.

This project embarks on a journey to uncover the intricate dynamics of flight pricing using a comprehensive dataset obtained from the "Ease My Trip" website. Our mission is not only to predict flight prices accurately but also to unravel valuable insights that will empower travelers in their quest for budget-friendly and convenient travel options.

### Data Collection and Methodology

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the dataset titled "Flight Price Prediction," available at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction). It contains comprehensive information about flight booking options from the "Ease My Trip" website for flight travel between India's top 6 metro cities.

The dataset consists of 300,261 distinct flight booking options and spans a 50-day period, from February 11th to March 31st, 2022. It was curated for the purpose of conducting data analysis and building predictive models to forecast flight prices accurately.

### Features

The dataset encompasses 11 essential features, including airline, flight code, source city, departure time, stops, arrival time, destination city, class, duration, days left, and the target variableâ€”price.

In this project, we will employ data preprocessing, feature engineering, and various machine learning models to predict flight prices accurately. Our objective is not only to build predictive models but also to provide travelers with valuable insights that can aid them in making informed decisions when booking flight tickets.

Join me on this expedition as we navigate through data, algorithms, and insights to demystify the world of flight pricing and empower travelers to embark on their journeys with confidence and cost-effectiveness.
